<h3>Key Products</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Distributed Documentation</p>
    <p>It used to be that you had to forward all your documentation requests through these centralised "libraries" of documentation. No longer. With OpenVapour, you can fully distribute your documentation to make the most of your available resources.</p>

    <p>Buzzword-Defined Networking (BDN)</p>
    <p>We believe that SDN has its limits and will only be as useful as far as standards like OpenFlow push the space. We are supporters of <acronym title="Buzzword-Defined Networking">BDN</acronym> which has no such limits. We aim to invent and extend the use of buzzwords in modern networks to fully realise their full potential. If you feel your current network could do with more buzzwords we are more than happy to sell you as many <acronym title="Three Letter Acronyms">TLAs</acronym> as you require.</p>
